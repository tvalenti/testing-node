# testing-node
Testing AWS Elastic Beanstalk, NodeJS, and Docker deployment.

I am using this as a test for CICD pipeline for developing a NodeJS app then dockerizing it and push it to github to be automatically built and deployed to AWS Elastic Beanstalk. This is not meant to be a live app but just a vessel for testing CICD pipeline and deployment.

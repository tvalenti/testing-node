# testing-node
Testing AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Buddy, NodeJS, and Docker deployment.

I am using this as a test for CICD pipeline for developing a NodeJS app then dockerizing it and push it to github to be automatically built and deployed to AWS Elastic Beanstalk. This is not meant to be a live app but just a vessel for testing CICD pipeline and deployment.


While learning the CICD pipeline I am learning how to build and deploy Docker images as well as understand the workings of AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Route53, Elastic Load Balancer and many other AWS services.
